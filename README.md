## Ultimate Filters\!


</div>

### Description

After downloading a lot of "complete aplications" that made nothing, I decided to send one that is not so complete, but that you can learn how to REALLY use graphical filters. Blur, Blur More, Sharpen, Sharpen More, Emboss, Difuse, Difuse More... You name it! And you can make your own filters so easy! this little proggy only has 3 hours of programming and testing... Should i work more on this? Tell me what you need! ohh.. btw, save command has a bug :) don't use it!
